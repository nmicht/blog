In the last days, a lot of thinking has been going in my mind about what is the meaning of friendships, the expectations and the social conventions.

As a neurodivergent person, I struggle to understand things where the concepts are so abstract as friendship. Things that may sound silly like "if I don't ask my friends how are they doing, then I'm a bad friend" are real. I would love to have a guide to be a good friend and learn the social conventions that would make me if not a good friend, at least a decent one.
