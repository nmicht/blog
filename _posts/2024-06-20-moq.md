title: Media over QUIC (MoQ)
tags: computer-networks protocols
---

Let's imagine you want to watch a video or play a game online. Sometimes, it can be really slow, or the video might stop and start a lot. That's because the internet has to send a lot of information back and forth, and sometimes things get a bit jammed up.
What is MoQ?

MoQ stands for "Media over QUIC." It’s like a special helper that makes sure videos and games can get to you quickly and smoothly over the internet.

It is an emerging protocol designed to facilitate the efficient streaming and real-time delivery of media content, such as videos and audio, over the QUIC protocol. QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections) is a transport layer network protocol developed by Google, which combines the benefits of TCP and UDP to provide a faster and more reliable internet experience.

## Key Features of MoQ:

1. **Low Latency**:
   - MoQ is designed to minimize latency, making it ideal for real-time media applications such as live streaming, video conferencing, and interactive media.

2. **Reliability**:
   - By leveraging QUIC’s capabilities, MoQ ensures reliable data delivery even in less stable network conditions, reducing packet loss and improving overall media quality.

3. **Scalability**:
   - MoQ can handle high volumes of media traffic efficiently, making it suitable for large-scale media distribution platforms.

4. **Adaptive Streaming**:
   - It supports adaptive bitrate streaming, which adjusts the quality of the media stream based on the current network conditions, providing a seamless viewing experience.

5. **Security**:
   - Built on top of QUIC, MoQ benefits from QUIC's strong security features, including encryption and authentication, to protect media content from eavesdropping and tampering.

### How MoQ Works:

- **Media Segmentation**: Breaking Things Down
  - Imagine your video is a big puzzle. Instead of sending the whole puzzle at once, MoQ breaks it into small pieces and sends them one by one. This way, if one piece gets lost, it can quickly resend just that piece without starting over.
  - Media content is divided into small segments or chunks, which are then transmitted over the QUIC protocol. This segmentation allows for better error correction and efficient retransmission of lost data.

- **Multiplexing**: Sending Multiple Things at Once
  - MoQ uses something called QUIC, which is like a super-fast highway just for the internet. This highway helps your video pieces travel really fast and not get stuck in traffic.
  - Let’s say you’re watching a video and chatting with a friend at the same time. MoQ can handle both things together without mixing them up, making sure both the video and your chat messages get to you quickly.
  - MoQ allows multiple media streams to be multiplexed over a single QUIC connection, reducing overhead and improving resource utilization.

- **Prioritization**: Smart Helper
  - If the internet gets busy, MoQ can decide which pieces of the video to send first, so you see the important parts without waiting. It’s like a smart helper organizing your puzzle pieces perfectly.
  - MoQ can prioritize certain media streams or segments, ensuring that critical content is delivered promptly. This is particularly important for interactive applications like video calls.

### Example: Google's Use of MoQ

Google, a pioneer in developing QUIC, is actively involved in the standardization and implementation of MoQ. By integrating MoQ into its media services, Google can offer improved streaming quality and reduced latency for platforms like YouTube and Google Meet. This enhances user experience by providing smooth playback and real-time interaction, even under varying network conditions.
