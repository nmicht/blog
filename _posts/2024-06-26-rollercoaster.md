It's now a month in my new job. It has been a rollercoaster, not just of emotions, but also in my sleeping patterns, ðŸ˜….

In the last month I learned so much more than what I learned in the almost two years at my last job.

Is it easy? No, not all. It is a extremely complicated area and unfortunately, the day only have 24hrs (I've been working for approximately 66% of the day ðŸ™ˆ).

Am I enjoying it? Hell yes! I'm exhausted and my brain has zero capacity, but the satisfaction I'm getting is worthy.

So yeah, a rollecoaster of emotions.
